Importing Hints
1. Check .csv for extra lines!!
2. If you have Boolean values, 0 is False, 1 is True
3. Check # of columns
4. Make sure data is *still* sorted by ID
5. Remember to skip first row

Process
1. Put data in 3rd normal form (use a spreadsheet)
2. When using a lookup, make sure data is alphabetical
3. Save tables as .csv files and remove any extra rows (open in notepad)
4. Create database tables
	- table names should not have spaces (no caps, no gaps = easy)
	- column names can have spaces if desired
	- for decimal values, specify the length and number of decimal points, for money, this might be (6, 2 ie: $1,000.00 to 2 dp)
5. Create first page...
	- config file
	- basic layout (html / css)
	- top bit needs database connection code
	- split into topbit, 'main div', bottombit
6. Create 'allentries.php' using JOIN query
7. Create other queries / search capability
8. Create Data entry form / forms
9. Boolean entries into data should NOT have speech marks

Error Checking (basic)
10. Use type="number" min=# to validate fields which need to include numbers.

Error Checking (refined)
- realise that basic error checking only gives error messages when users try and hit <submit> and then its one error at a time which is annoying.  Replace this with php error messages and formatted red boxes so that users can fix all their mistakes at once.
ie: we trialled html error checking, trialled php checking and have realised that in most cases php checking is better.

Success Page: Remember to use join query on add_success and put in $count so that you can recycle results.php.  Also, any numbers should be equals (=) not 'like'.
