The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman. From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed! Can you survive five nights at Freddy's? NOTE: Strong nerves, perseverance, and a decent device are required to fully enjoy this game. You are warned. For all the simplicity of the game's controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddys is frightening. It's a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It's elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games. -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com #MadeWithFusion"

It is like a virtual pet or Tamagotchi game on a planetary level. Play God by manipulating the sunlight and the rain in order to grow as large a population as possible. My Planet runs in real time, even when the the game is closed. Therefore, you must keep checking back throughout the day to make sure your planet is running at optimal levels. The controls are simple to use, by mastery can take weeks. Can you achieve the ultimate goal of growing your planet to over 1,000,000 people? Or will your planet burn under the sun while your people anguish? The choice is yours! The ultimate goal of My Planet is to grow a happy and thriving population. Your population will continue to grow as long as you have a healthy level of Vegetation on your planet (represented by the green bar). The more vegetation you have, the faster your population will grow. Likewise, if your vegetation levels get too low, your people will starve to death and population will begin to decline. Vegetation grows when it has the proper amount of sunlight and water. For optimal vegetation and thus population growth, you must try to keep your Sun and Water levels in the sweet spot, indicated by your Sun and Water meters being 50% full. If you have too much sunlight, vegetation will dry up and your people will die. If you have too little sunlight, vegetation cannot grow and your people will starve. Same concept with water. If you have too much, vegetation will flood out and die. To little, and drought will set in. Check your planet every day to make sure you have the optimal amount of sun and water! I am always looking to improve my apps, so if you have any ideas on how to make My Planet better, please let me know. I will continue to update and improve the game, so let me know what you would like to see added in the future! This app is for you guys!"

Or maybe you want to harness the electric power and sell it for a profit? Reactor allows you to do that and so much more in one of the most intense and one of a kind strategy games that you have ever played. The premise in Reactor is very simple, you have to create power plants and generate as much electricity and heat as possible all while keeping everything under control and converting it into a lot of money. You will have to start off easy, with the help of small wind turbines that will generate a little electricity, enough to get your business going. Then you have to focus on getting stuff like offices and more turbines, solar panels, generators, coal burners, and in the end you will have the ability to create your own reactor, be it a nuclear, thermonuclear or fusion reactor, something that is very important to keep an eye on. Reactors are by far the best if you want a great return on investment but they are also the less stable and you have to manage heat as they can easily become unstable. With more than 10 maps to unlock and play, you will always have your hands full as you will try to figure out the best way to make insane profits and obtain a stellar result. You can play it safe and run a business that brings less but stable amounts of money, or you can check out alternative methods that are riskier but with a better return on investment. Reactor is an astounding idle game, one that manages to bring in front extraordinary gameplay moments and stunning opportunities. It's very fun to play and you can easily use it as an idle game, because resource production will take place even as you go away, which is even more exciting. In Reactor you have all the power in your hands and it all comes down to you to make the right choice and take this one of a kind gameplay mechanic to new heights. With incredibly fun gameplay, nice mechanics and interesting choices, Reactor is the ultimate game that you want to play. A sheer combination of strategy, idle gaming and perfect unlock system, Reactor will help you spend your time wisely with amazing moments and a stellar outcome. Features: \tMultiple buildings to choose from \tA complex game that's easy to learn and hard to master \tIdling mechanic that allows you to earn resources even if you are offline \tYou have the first map for free, the others need to be unlocked \tMultiple upgrades to choose from \tInteresting gameplay mechanics that you have to keep an eye on at all costs \tStellar research system"
